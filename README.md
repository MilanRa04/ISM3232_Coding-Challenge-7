Company Department Salary Calculation
In this challenge, you will create a recursive function to calculate the total salary expenditure for each department in a company. The company is divided into multiple departments, and each department has employees who might be organized in a hierarchy. Youâ€™ll use recursion to navigate through the employees in a department and calculate the total salary expenditure for that department.

A company wants to calculate the total salary expenditure for each of its departments. Each department has multiple employees, and some employees may have subordinates who report to them. The company needs a system that: 1. Stores information about each department, including its name, employees, and their respective subordinates. 2. Allows calculation of the total salary for a department, including the salaries of all employees and their subordinates within that department.
